# **Final Project: React Responsive Design Implementation with Tailwind CSS**

## **Objective**
Recreate the provided LG (desktop) design with perfect layout accuracy while demonstrating creativity through custom branding, content creation, and color system implementation. You will maintain exact spacing, component positioning, and layout structure from both designs while transforming the content to reflect your unique brand identity.

---

## **Requirements**

### **1. Design Implementation**
- **Provided Breakpoints (LG)**
  - Precisely replicate the spacing between all components
  - Maintain exact photo and content positioning as shown in the designs
  - Keep all layout proportions and component arrangements identical
  - Grid/flex structures must match the original designs
  
- **What You MUST Keep**
  - Component spacing (margins, padding, gaps)
  - Layout structure and grid systems
  - Content hierarchy and positioning
  - Image placement and aspect ratios
  - Navigation structure and placement
  
- **What You MUST Change**
  - All text content (create your own brand story)
  - Color scheme (develop your unique palette)
  - Images (use your own high-quality imagery)
  - Brand identity (logo, name, tagline)
  - Icons and decorative elements

### **2. Technical Stack Requirements**
- **React** (v18+): Functional components with hooks
- **Tailwind CSS** (v3+): All styling must use Tailwind utilities
- **Component Structure**:
  ```
  src/
  ├── components/
  │   ├── layout/
  │   │   ├── Header.jsx
  │   │   ├── Footer.jsx
  │   │   └── Navigation.jsx
  │   ├── sections/
  │   │   ├── Hero.jsx
  │   │   ├── Features.jsx
  │   │   └── [other sections]
  │   └── common/
  │       ├── Card.jsx
  │       ├── Button.jsx
  │       └── [reusable components]
  ├── assets/
  │   └── images/
  └── App.jsx
  ```

### **3. Responsive Design Requirements**
- **Breakpoint Implementation**:
  - SM: 640px and below (mobile)
  - MD: 641px - 1023px (your creative interpretation)
  - LG: 1024px and above (desktop)
  
- **MD and SM Breakpoint (Your Design)**:
  - Create a tablet and mobile view that aligns with the LG design
  - Must maintain visual consistency with the provided design
  - Demonstrate smooth responsive transitions

### **4. Content & Branding Guidelines**

#### **Brand Development**
- Create a complete brand identity including:
  - Brand name and tagline
  - Value proposition
  - Target audience definition
  - Brand voice and tone

#### **Content Requirements**
- All text must be original and relevant to your brand
- Minimum content sections:
  - Hero with compelling headline and CTA
  - At least 3 feature/service sections
  - About/story section
  - Contact/CTA section
- Content must be professionally written (no Lorem Ipsum in production)

#### **Image Requirements**
- High-quality images only (minimum 1920x1080 for hero, 800x600 for cards)
- Properly optimized for web (WebP or optimized JPEG/PNG)
- Consistent visual style across all images
- Include alt text for accessibility
- Sources: Unsplash, Pexels, or original photography
- Must include image credits in README

### **5. Color System & Typography**

#### **Color Palette**
- Minimum 5 colors defined in Tailwind config:
  - Primary (main brand color)
  - Secondary (supporting color)
  - Accent (CTA/highlight color)
  - Neutral dark (text)
  - Neutral light (backgrounds)
- Must pass WCAG AA contrast requirements
- Document color psychology and choice rationale

#### **Typography**
- Define custom font stack in Tailwind config in case you are using a custom font
- Consistent type scale across breakpoints
- Minimum 3 font weight variations

### **6. Component Requirements**
- **Reusable Components** (minimum):
  - Button component with variants (primary, secondary, outline)
  - Card component with props for customization
  - Section wrapper component for consistent spacing
  - Responsive image component with lazy loading

- **Component Best Practices**:
  - PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces
  - Destructured props
  - Conditional rendering for responsive behavior
  - Custom hooks for repeated logic

### **7. Performance & Accessibility**
- Lighthouse score requirements:
  - Performance: 85+
  - Accessibility: 95+
  - Best Practices: 90+
  - SEO: 90+
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Proper semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support

### **8. Deployment Requirements**
- **Hosting Platforms** (choose one):
  - Vercel
  - Netlify
  - Railway
  - Render
  - GitHub Pages (with proper routing configuration)

- **Deployment Checklist**:
  - Environment variables properly configured
  - Build optimization enabled
  - Custom domain (optional but bonus points)
  - SSL certificate active
  - Analytics integration (Google Analytics or similar)
