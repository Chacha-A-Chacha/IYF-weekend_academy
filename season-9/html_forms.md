# **HTML Forms Implementation Assignment**

## **Objective**
Implement a structured HTML form based on provided specifications, demonstrating semantic HTML practices and proper repository documentation.

## **Assignment Overview**
You will receive a **PDF document** containing form input specifications and requirements. Your task is to create a functional HTML implementation using semantic HTML structure.

---

## **Instructions:**

### **1. Form Implementation**
- Study the provided PDF specifications carefully
- Create a complete HTML form following the outlined structure
- Apply **semantic HTML principles** throughout your implementation
- Ensure proper accessibility standards are met
- **No CSS styling required** - focus on semantic structure and functionality

### **2. Repository Setup**
Create a **GitHub repository** with the following structure:
```
your-repo-name/
├── index.html
└── README.md
```

### **3. Repository Requirements**

**index.html**
- Your complete HTML form implementation
- Must be functional and semantically structured
- Follow HTML5 standards and best practices

**README.md**
- Document your repository purpose and contents
- Explain your implementation approach
- Include any relevant information about your form structure

### **4. README Documentation Standards**
Your README should include:
- **Project title and description**
- **Purpose** of the form and its sections
- **File structure** explanation
- **Implementation notes** about your approach
- **How to use/view** the form

**README Writing Resources:**
- [GitHub's Guide to READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)
- [Make a README Template](https://www.makeareadme.com/)
- [README Best Practices](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template)

### **5. Submission Requirements**
- **Submit your GitHub repository link**
- Ensure repository is **public** and accessible
- Verify that **index.html opens and displays correctly** in browsers
- **README.md must be complete** and informative

### **6. Evaluation Focus**
- **Semantic HTML implementation** quality
- **Form functionality** and proper structure
- **Repository organization** and documentation
- **README clarity** and completeness
- **Code quality** and best practices adherence

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on semantic meaning rather than visual appearance
- Pay attention to proper labeling and form accessibility
- Your implementation should demonstrate understanding of HTML form elements and structure
- Repository documentation is as important as the code itself
