# **Final Project: Responsive Design Implementation**

## **Objective**
Recreate the provided LG breakpoint mockup design while demonstrating creativity in color schemes, content branding, and additional breakpoint implementations. You must maintain only the card sizes, orientation, and spacing from the original design in large screens—everything else should reflect your unique creative interpretation.

---

## **Requirements**
### **1. Design Implementation**
- **LG Breakpoint (Provided Design)**  
  - Precisely replicate the card sizes, layout orientation, and spacing from the mockup.  
  - **Do not copy the color scheme**—apply your own creative color choices.  

- **New SM & MD Breakpoints (Your Creativity)**  
  - Design entirely new SM (mobile) and MD (tablet) breakpoints.  
  - Only structural consistency (e.g., card spacing) is required in LG view; adapt other elements (e.g., navigation, typography) freely but follow best practices.  

### **2. Color System Rules**
- Use **at least 3 colors** (primary, secondary, accent) with proper contrast (WCAG AA compliant).  
- Cite your color choices with reasoning (e.g., "Dark blue for trust, coral for calls-to-action").  
- Tools: [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/), or [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).  

### **3. Content & Branding**
- Replace all placeholder content (text/images) with **your own themed content** (e.g., if the mockup is for "TechCorp," rebrand as "EcoLife" for sustainability).  
- Ensure content aligns with your color scheme (e.g., vibrant colors for a youth brand, muted tones for luxury).  

### **4. Technical Implementation**
- **Choose one stack**:  
  - **Pure HTML/CSS/JS**: Static site with organized files (e.g., `css/`, `js/`, `assets/`).  
  - **Framework (React/Vue/Angular)**: Component-based structure (e.g., `components/Card.js`, `styles/global.css`).  
- **Responsive Techniques**: Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for layouts; media queries for breakpoints.  

### **5. Deployment**
- **GitHub Pages (HTML)**:  
  - Structure:  
    ```plaintext
    project-root/
    ├── index.html
    ├── css/
    │   └── style.css  
    ├── js/
    │   └── script.js  
    └── assets/ (images/icons)  
    ```  
  - Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings (branch: `main`/`gh-pages`).  
  - URL format: `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>`.  

- **Vercel/Netlify (Frameworks)**:  
  - Push to GitHub/GitLab and connect to Vercel/Netlify.  
  - Ensure build commands (e.g., `npm run build`) are configured.

## **Submission Checklist**
1. **Code**:  
   - Clean, commented code with consistent naming conventions.  
   - No inline styles; use external CSS/Sass.  
2. **Design Documentation**:  
   - Short `README.md` explaining:  
     - Your color system (palette + rationale).  
     - Breakpoint logic (e.g., "MD switches to 2-column grid").  
     - How you diverged creatively from the mockup (beyond colors).  
3. **Hosted Links**:  
   - GitHub Pages/Vercel/Netlify URL in submission.  
   - Repository link (ensure it’s public).

## **Grading Criteria**
- **Accuracy**: LG layout matches mockup structure (20%).  
- **Creativity**: Unique color scheme, branding, and SM/MD breakpoints (30%).  
- **Code Quality**: Organization, responsiveness, and accessibility (30%).  
- **Deployment**: Functional hosted site with zero broken links (20%).
